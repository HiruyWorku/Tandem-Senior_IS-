# Tandem 

Tandem is a near-real-time video conferencing application that enables natural communication between Deaf or Hard of Hearing(DHH) and hearing individuals. A DHH user signs via webcam; the ML model recognises the ASL letter/gesture, converts it to text, and the hearing user hears it spoken aloud and vice versa, speech is captioned and rendered as a signing avatar.
